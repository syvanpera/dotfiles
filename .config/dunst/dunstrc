  ### Display ###

  # Which monitor should the notifications be displayed on.
  monitor = 0

  # Display notification on focused monitor.  Possible modes are:
  #   mouse: follow mouse pointer
  #   keyboard: follow window with keyboard focus
  #   none: don't follow anything
  #
  # "keyboard" needs a window manager that exports the
  # _NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW property.
  # This should be the case for almost all modern window managers.
  #
  # If this option is set to mouse or keyboard, the monitor option
  # will be ignored.
  follow = none

  # The geometry of the window:
  #   [{width}]x{height}[+/-{x}+/-{y}]
  # The geometry of the message window.
  # The height is measured in number of notifications everything elxse
  # in pixels.  If the width is omitted but the height is given
  # ("-geometry x2"), the message window expands over the whole screen
  # (dmenu-like).  If width is 0, the window expands to the longest
  # message displayed.  A positive x is measured from the left, a
  # negative from the right side of the screen.  Y is measured from
  # the top and down respectively.
  # The width can be negative.  In this case the actual width is the
  # screen width minus the width defined in within the geometry option.

  ### Text ###

  # The spacing between lines.  If the height is smaller than the
  # font height, it will get raised to the font height.

  # Possible values are:
  # full: Allow a small subset of html markup in notifications:
  #        <b>bold</b>
  #        <i>italic</i>
  #        <s>strikethrough</s>
  #        <u>underline</u>

  #
  # strip: This setting is provided for compatibility with some broken
  #        clients that send markup even though it's not enabled on the
  #        server. Dunst will try to strip the markup but the parsing is
  #        simplistic so using this option outside of matching rules for
  #        specific applications *IS GREATLY DISCOURAGED*.
  #
  # no:    Disable markup parsing, incoming notifications will be treated as
  #        plain text. Dunst will not advertise that it has the body-markup
  #        capability if this is set as a global setting.
  #
  # It's important to note that markup inside the format option will be parsed
  # regardless of what this is set to.
  markup = full

  # The format of the message.  Possible variables are:
  #   %a  appname
  #   %s  summary
  #   %b  body

  #   %I  iconname (without its path)
  #   %p  progress value if set ([  0%] to [100%]) or nothing
  #   %n  progress value if set without any extra characters
  #   %%  Literal %
  # Markup is allowed
